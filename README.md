# CafiineServer
An extended Cafiine server mostly rewritten from scratch, handling the default Wii U Cafiine clients, based on the original server by MrRean.

It offers the following new functionality:
- Support for encrypted, hash-signed and timebombed [game data pack files](https://github.com/Syroot/CafiineServer/wiki/Game-Packs).
- Dump mode to dump any queried file automatically, into a separate directory dedicated for dumps.
- Command line parameters to set port and network interface to listen on.
- Optimized console output and file logging.
- Several bigger and smaller code and performance optimizations.

The features are described in detail on the [wiki](https://github.com/Syroot/CafiineServer/wiki).
