# CafiineServer
An extended Cafiine server mostly rewritten from scratch, based on the original server by Chadderz.

It handles the default Wii U Cafiine clients, offering the following new functionality:
- Support for encrypted, signed and time-bombed game data package files. The intention behind this is to share game mods without them getting abused online and keeping a little control of their spread.
- Several bigger and smaller code optimizations.
- Optimized console output and logging.
